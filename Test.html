<h3 id="low-level-security-consulting-and-auditing">Low-level security consulting and auditing</h3>

<p>With our extensive background in <a href="/resources/">system-level security
research</a>, our expert team of world-class security
specialists is prepared to audit your C, C++, and assembly code across a
variety of architectures, such as x86, ARM, MIPS, and many more.</p>

<p>We’ve been working at the forefront of Intel SGX for many years (see
<a href="#gramine-consulting">Gramine consulting</a>), and we’re ready to bring
that expertise to bear on your SGX use cases, from helping you devise,
deploy, and audit SGX-based solutions to consulting on the security of
SGX itself.</p>

<p>Whereas most teams specialize exclusively in either offensive or
defensive security, ours is renowned in both. Invisible Things Lab has
presented numerous attacks against virtualization systems and Intel
security technologies, including a famous series of exploits against
Intel Trusted Execution Technology.</p>

<p>Our attack against Intel VT-d, allowing for a full VM escape, is still
the only one that has been demonstrated. We’re also known for showing
that it’s possible to break into Intel vPro BIOS and Active Management
Technology. This expertise in how to “break” secure systems gives us a
unique advantage in building them: We know how to think like attackers,
and we understand how to design systems to be truly secure from the
ground up.</p>

<p>Our team is among the best in the world at identifying exploits in
binaries and developing mitigations against them. We can help you
analyze the impact of security vulnerabilities, create proof-of-concept
exploits, decide on appropriate mitigation measures, and advise on
implementing and configuring them.</p>

<p>With our deep knowledge of kernel security, we advise on kernel
compromises, advanced rootkits, integrity checking, and kernel
exploitation techniques. Not only can we help you design and implement
kernel and system code; we can also perform a comprehensive security
review of an existing or planned implementation.</p>

<p>With decades of experience on the cutting edge of virtualization
security, we’re well-equipped to advise on hypervisor attacks, secure
hypervisor design, and secure hypervisor implementation. In addition, we
offer security reviews on all of these aspects of virtualization.</p>

<p>Last but not least, our extensive hardware and firmware security
experience makes us among the best choices in the world for BIOS, SMM,
and chipset security, including the identification of vulnerabilities,
the development of proof-of-concept exploits, and comprehensive code
review. This includes decades of experience in advanced security
technologies like x86 virtualization (e.g., VT-x, VT-d, and AMD-V),
Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT), and Trusted Platform Modules
(TPMs).</p>

<h3 id="qubes-os-consulting">Qubes OS consulting</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/">Qubes OS</a> takes a uniquely effective
approach to security. While the cybersecurity threats to companies and
individuals have sharply increased in both number and sophistication,
conventional operating systems are generally still monolithic in nature,
leaving them vulnerable to total system compromise in the event of a
zero-day exploit.</p>

<p>By contrast, Qubes has pioneered an approach called Security by
Compartmentalization, which allows users to compartmentalize different
digital activities into securely isolated compartments called “qubes” so
that if one qube is compromised, the others remain unaffected. Moreover,
Qubes seamlessly integrates all of these secure containers into a
unified desktop environment, providing a decisive advantage in user
experience and productivity over traditional methods of isolation.</p>

<h3 id="gramine-consulting">Gramine consulting</h3>

<p><a href="https://gramineproject.io/">Gramine</a> is a library OS designed to run
Linux applications in restricted environments like Intel SGX enclaves.
This approach minimizes the porting effort required when migrating to
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-confidential-computing">confidential
computing</a>
while maintaining a minimal attack surface. Invisible Things Lab is the
driving force behind the core development of Gramine and employs the
leading experts on this cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>If you have a speaking request for Joanna Rutkowska, please read <a href="https://blog.invisiblethings.org/speaking/">this
page</a> first. Please note
that ITL, like many other companies, uses a commercial Mail Service
Provider (MSP) for its email hosting. This means that all email messages
traverse through a third party mail server unencrypted (even if SSL/TLS
is used to transfer messages between servers). The MSP thus has, by
definition, unrestricted access to any unencrypted email sent to and
from ITL. This means that all unencrypted email messages should be
treated as if they are being read by third parties. Please use
encryption when sending sensitive information to ITL (see our PGP key
below). ITL cannot be held responsible for any potential leaks of
information sent via unencrypted email.</p>

<h3 id="pgp-key">PGP Key</h3>

<p>Our general PGP key for email encryption can be found
<a href="/invisible_things_lab.asc">here</a>. Individual PGP keys can be found under
each member profile above. In order to exclude the possibility of
Man-in-the-Middle attacks, you are encouraged to verify the fingerprints
of all keys before use. This can be done either by phone or by looking
on the backs of our business cards. This website should not be trusted
for key verification.</p>
